# # Evaluating Decision Quality: A Comprehensive Guide for Engineering Leaders

## Introduction

In our [post on decision-making methods](./unlock-organizational-transformation-consent-decision-making), we delved into the dynamics of decision-making in organizations, drawing attention to the different methods and their impact on your team's success and culture. We put a spotlight on consent-based decision-making and explored its potential in fostering a culture of openness, respect, and innovation. Yet, a crucial part of the decision-making process remains unexplored: how do we evaluate the quality of these decisions?

Evaluating decision quality in hindsight isn't just a dry exercise—it's a revealing journey. As leaders and teams, we get to see how our past decisions have carved out the path our organization walks today. More importantly, we get a roadmap that guides us to make even better choices in the future.

In the world of engineering, the stakes are often high. Making the right decisions can lead to innovative breakthroughs, while incorrect ones can result in costly delays, or worse, catastrophic failures. The quality of our decisions, however, should not be judged solely by their outcomes. This might seem counterintuitive, but there's a wealth of insight to be gained when we separate decision quality from outcomes.

## The Role of Probability in Decision Making

As engineers, we're quite familiar with dealing with probabilities. We routinely use probabilistic models to predict failure rates, assess risks, estimate when work will be completed, and make informed decisions about design, materials, and processes. The same mathematical reasoning is at the decision making in engineering organizations.

Each decision we make is a small leap into the future. We gather and analyze data like detectives, weighing different scenarios and finally, choose the option we believe has the highest probability of success—like placing a well-informed bet on tomorrow. However, even with a sound decision-making process and thorough analysis, improbable outcomes can and will happen.

When assessing a large number of decisions, it's not uncommon to see outcomes that, in isolation, would be considered highly unlikely. That's simply how probabilities work. We're often surprised by these "black swan" events because our brains aren't intuitively wired to understand probabilistic events. But understanding this concept can help us make sense of surprising outcomes and improve our future decision-making processes.

## Learning from Decisions: The Good and the Bad

Learning from our decisions in ways that are not dependent on the outcome is crucial for long-term success. It's easy to fall into the trap of judging a decision solely by its outcome, but that ignores the complex interplay of factors, including luck, unknowable information and uncontrollable circumstances, which also contribute to the result. This is especially true for Engineering Project Decisions, where both technical and non-technical factors can affect the outcome.

We understand some decisions need to be made more quickly than others. Some decisions don't need to be made quickly, but should be anyways! Other decisions are worth engaging with a lengthy, analytical process. In making these determinations we are deliberately balancing the energy we can put into decision-making with our appetite for adverse outcomes. In any case, a poor outcome doesn't always mean we should have made the decision differently -- but it could mean exactly that.

When a decision leads to a successful outcome, we should examine why it worked. Did we make a good call based on sound analysis, or did we simply get lucky? Similarly, when a decision doesn't pan out as expected, we need to understand why. Was the decision flawed, or were the unfavorable results due to factors beyond our control?

## Quality of Information and Decision Making

The quality of information used to make a decision can greatly impact the outcome. In engineering, we're often trying to make decisions with incomplete or imperfect information. This uncertainty can lead to analysis paralysis, where we spend excessive time and resources trying to gather more information, hoping to make a perfect decision. Often the fastest way to gather more information is to make more and smaller decisions.

It's important to understand that no decision can be entirely risk-free. Often, it's more beneficial to make a well-informed decision with the available data and adjust course as new information comes in, rather than waiting for perfect information that may never arrive. 

This approach implies emphasizing making the smallest possible decision you can to make progress and learn new information. Decisions and the resulting actions create the feedback loop where you then learn and make new decisions. Just like agile development, the shorter we tighten that loop, through making smaller decisions and more frequent actions, the more we learn and adapt to the contexts we are operating within.

## Implementing a Decision Journal

A decision journal can be a powerful tool to help us learn from our decisions and improve our decision-making process. It's a place to document not only the decision and its outcome, but also the reasoning behind it, the information you had on hand, the information you could not know or chose not to learn due to constraints, the uncertainties involved, and the expected result best expressed in roughly estimated probabilities. 

By performing retrospective decision analysis, we can gain insights into our decision-making patterns, identify any biases we may have, and improve our ability to make predictions about the future. Over time, reviewing this journal can help us understand when we've made sound decisions and when we've merely been fortunate. When reviewing past decisions consider:

- Do you always under-estimate a certain type of outcome?
- Should you spend more or less time gathering information? 
- Do you spend too much time gathering irrelevant information and miss broader context?
- Are you calibrating the length of coming to a decision properly?
- Are you over-investing on decisions that are easily reversible?
- Are you over-investing on decisions where two or more options can all lead to favorable outcomes and it's best to flip a coin or roll the dice and move onto something where the range of outcomes are more significant? 

## Leadership's Role in Fostering a Learning Culture

As engineering leaders, we play a crucial role in fostering a culture that values learning from decisions, regardless of their outcomes. All good engineering management strategies should have learning and adaptability as core tenets. As you are elevated in an organization, it is almost always best to delegate decisions as close to the work as possible and then help them make decisions better. It's our job as leaders to create an environment where good decision-making practices are recognized and rewarded, even when the outcome is unfavorable. We want to create the safety necessary to make innovative changes and keep the pace of development high.

We can model this approach by openly discussing our decisions and their outcomes, encouraging transparency and shared learning. Moreover, we can create a space for team members to share their decision-making experiences and learn from each from each other. This culture of learning and openness can help our teams become more resilient and adaptive, better prepared to face the challenges of the dynamic engineering landscape.

## Risk Management and Decision-Making

Risk management in engineering is an inherent part of the decision-making process. Each decision we make involves a certain level of risk, whether it's choosing a new software platform or deciding on a project's timeline. The key is to manage and mitigate these risks effectively. This is where a strong decision-making process, coupled with a solid understanding of probabilities, becomes crucial.

When we make decisions, we're essentially making predictions about the future based on the information we have at the moment. The more we understand about probabilities, the better our predictions—and hence our decisions—will be.

Moreover, understanding probabilities helps us accept that even the best decisions can lead to undesirable outcomes, and vice versa. This acceptance allows us to learn from our decisions independently of their outcomes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## Enhancing Stakeholder Communication through Deliberate Decision-Making

Deliberate decision-making not only improves the quality of our choices and outcomes within our teams, but it also significantly enhances our ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders.

Stakeholders—whether they are clients, c-suite executives, or other teams within our organization—have a vested interest in the decisions we make. They're impacted by our choices and have a right to understand the rationale behind them. Here's how our intentional decision-making processes can help:

**1. Transparency and Trust:** By adopting a deliberate decision-making process, we inherently build a framework that is transparent and comprehensible. When we can clearly articulate the steps we took, the probabilities we considered, and the information we used to reach a decision, we provide stakeholders with a window into our thought process. This transparency fosters trust, as stakeholders can see that our decisions are not arbitrary, but rather grounded in careful consideration and analysis.

**2. Alignment and Expectation Management:** With our methodical approach to decision-making, we're better equipped to set and manage expectations. If we've considered and communicated the probable outcomes of a decision (including those that are less favorable), stakeholders will be more prepared for a range of scenarios. This proactive alignment can prevent confusion and disappointment down the line.

**3. Mitigating Misunderstandings:** A well-documented decision-making process, such as using a decision journal, can also serve as a reference point for discussions with stakeholders. If questions or disagreements arise, we can revisit our documented decision-making process. Often the records of the context we knew to be true when we made the decision has changed rapidly since then and is not properly recalled. This record not only provides a basis for discussion but also helps to prevent misinterpretations or memory biases.

In essence, intentional and transparent decision-making is a powerful communication tool. It helps us establish trust, manage expectations, resolve disagreements, and foster collaboration with our stakeholders, paving the way for more successful engineering projects and stronger relationships.

## Decision-Making and the Future of Engineering

As we continue to navigate the complexities of engineering, the importance of solid engineering decision-making processes becomes increasingly evident. By understanding the role of probabilities, appreciating the impact of information quality,  fostering a culture of learning from our decisions, and communicating the additional context and probabilities we consider during the process we can guide our teams to greater success.

With the aid of tools like a decision journal, we can enhance our ability to evaluate and improve our decision-making practices over time. This not only benefits us as individuals but also strengthens our teams and our organizations.

In conclusion, the path to better decision-making in engineering is not a straight line, nor is it solely determined by the outcomes. It involves understanding the intricacies of probabilities, the quality of information, and the culture of learning from decisions—good or bad. As leaders in the engineering field, it is our role to foster this understanding and guide our teams towards a future defined by innovative success and continuous learning.
