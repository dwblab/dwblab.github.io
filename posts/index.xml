      <description>The COVID-19 pandemic sent shockwaves across the globe, forcing many organizations to shift from office-first to remote work almost overnight. Tech companies, in particular, seemed well-positioned to adapt to this change. Companies continued to grow and launch new products.

Why are so many people upset about these return to office announcements?</description>
