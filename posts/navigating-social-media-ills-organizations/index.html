It starts with leaders understanding how these attitudes can create the wrong incentives on their teams and to deliberately create incentives that promote long-term success.\nTo accomplish anything meaningful you need a team of people.

Don’t create systems of promotions that cause the cannibalization of your products and success. Tirelessly focus projects and programs on aligned business outcomes. Deeply appreciate and have a system for rewarding people who are preventing fires. It’s harder to quantify their impact, but these are the individuals you need the most. This is not an exhaustive list but illustrative of the type of thinking needed to counteract social-media-led thinking that is collectively getting rewarded in business. It is imperative that leaders think deeply about incentives within their organizations and recalibrate them to align behavior with desired outcomes.\n","wordCount":"364","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-10-02T16:48:29-05:00","dateModified":"2023-10-02T16:48:29-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.dwblab.com/posts/navigating-social-media-ills-organizations/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"dwblab - Home of Douglas Breault: Innovative Leadership and Engineering","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.dwblab.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.dwblab.com/ accesskey=h title="dwblab (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.dwblab.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>dwblab</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.dwblab.com/archives title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.dwblab.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.dwblab.com/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.dwblab.com/contact title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.dwblab.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.dwblab.com/posts/>Writings</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Navigating the Ills of Social Media in Our Organizations</h1><div class=post-description>Boastful self-promotion on LinkedIn is more than annoying, it’s both a cause and consequence of organizational underperformance.
